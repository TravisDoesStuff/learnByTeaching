# The Developer
I've been a web-based software developer professionally for 6 years, working with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Along with that I also been working with additional frameworks and libraries such as Zend, React, Lumen, and Vue on the side.

Some of my favorite tasks on the job have been researching UI libraries and building interfaces for customer-facing applications -- which include Material UI, Bootstrap, and Semantic UI; all which to provide a positive experience to users of the applications.

My professional work has helped surgery patients learn and understand their recovery post-operation. I have also helped millions of utility customers view and understand their energy usage and provide ways to reduce usage to save more money, and the environment.

##### *I'm not sure if I want to continue writing software.*

I started to learn programming in my second year of college, I was primarily driven down this path because people saw me being "good at computers" and as a means of living a comfortable lifestyle. I did enough to get by in understanding Computer Science theory and algorithms. Most of my efforts went into creative works such as video editing, 3D graphics, animation, and web design. A lot of my efforts also went into some non-tech courses and projects including psychology, sociology, and earth sciences.

Most developers learn more in the first six months on the job than they do throughout college, that was the same case for me too. I have worked with professional development teams to push out software-as-a-service (saas) applications that help customers understand data in order to make informed decisions. I have also been directly facing with clients in order to understand their needs and be able to anticipate what they may need that they may not realize, and ask the right questions to build the applications.

In my more recent years as a developer I have been neglecting to keep up professionally in the tech that I want to work with, this has done some **serious** harm to my career progression. I take full responsibility for this negligence and should have at least tried to do even a little bit of research and practice what I enjoy and could apply to the software developer field. In light of the stresses seen in the year 2020 my mental health has also degraded to further dull my interests in the field and willpower to apply myself.

That's in the past, what matters now is doing my best to get back on track. I'm already doing a lot better just by writing this readme.md as it gives a sense of progression and have been learning things I may have forgotten about. There is no doubt I have many knowledge gaps I need to somehow find and fill in as well. I understand that not knowing everything is normal for developers and why it is important to be continuously learning. While I don't code much outside of work, I'm still a curious person always wanting to learn new things, and looking for new ways to be creative both in and outside of my field.

 Recently I have learned of the User Experience (UX) field where designers work with people and research in order to understand what is needed and be able to design a visual and interactive experience. Oftentimes I care about the end-result and whether the application looks and *feels* good to use. I also have a history of putting so much effort into visual design projects yet can also apply my professional background in programming in knowing the strengths and limitations of what is being built. I also see the world much differently having read and scribbled in notes in a few books on design theory. *I have been seriously considering switching to this path and have been researching schooling options and the jobs UXers do.*

Even if I stay within the software development field, there is still always room for lateral movement given how learning is often encouraged in this career path. I'm assuming that programmers naturally love to learn and it doesn't always have to be limited to coding.

## This Project

The purpose of this project is to journal my learning in both design and development as I learn through research, networking, and practice. The way it will be written is to write in a way that someone at my level can understand so I don't become to redundant at teaching/learning the very basics I've known since college. I'm aware that one of best ways I learn something is by teaching to others, to whomever is reading this project. It will also be most likely me who looks back to this since software developers are often their own worst enemy. I never was great at creating things only for myself but I plan and hope this may help someone else out in a similar path. My situation feels unique but I'm certain that I wasn't the first nor the last to experience this.

To begin I'm going to go over articles to find what other people in my situation have been through and how they managed to work their way out of it success. I'm going to review and find some advanced HTML and CSS concepts I saw on a recent skill assessment I wasn't aware of. From there on I can start reviewing JavaScript (JS) and going over some old projects and potentially creating new ones to learn and relearn JS libraries such as React and Vue.

For UX, I'm giving Figma a go at not just reading but actually creating a framework and prototype, I can then continue on to trying out InVision and Adobe XD. I will also network with UX designers and developers to work my way through as well. Also going to review the books I have read to apply those practices to this project and others.

My goal is to see what parts of the entire design and development process I enjoy the most and relearn what I have been missing for the past two years. This is pretty much a personal log of my goals and what I have accomplished that day as a developer and/or designer and what I want to accomplish that day, **one day at a time**. It is certain that this project will go through many iterations as I apply more aspects to it as well.

I continue to love creating things for people, designing and developing software is one medium of creation.
